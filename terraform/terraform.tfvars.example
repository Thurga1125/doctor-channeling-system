# AWS Configuration
aws_region      = "eu-north-1"                      # AWS region for deployment
ami_id          = "ami-0705384c0b33c194c"          # Ubuntu 24.04 LTS AMI ID for eu-north-1
instance_type   = "t3.micro"                        # EC2 instance type
key_name        = "doctor-channeling-key"           # Name of your SSH key pair (must exist in AWS)
environment     = "production"                       # Environment name (dev, staging, production)

# Network Configuration
ssh_cidr_blocks = ["YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32"]           # Restrict SSH access to your IP (e.g., "203.0.113.0/32")

# MongoDB Credentials (stored in AWS Secrets Manager)
mongodb_username = "admin"                          # MongoDB admin username
mongodb_password = "CHANGE_THIS_STRONG_PASSWORD"    # MongoDB admin password (use strong password!)
mongodb_database = "doctor_channeling"              # MongoDB database name

# Docker Hub Credentials (for CI/CD)
docker_hub_username = "your-dockerhub-username"    # Your Docker Hub username
docker_hub_password = "CHANGE_THIS_PASSWORD"        # Your Docker Hub password or access token

# CloudWatch Alarms (optional)
sns_topic_arn = ""                                  # SNS topic ARN for alarm notifications (leave empty if not using)

# SSL Configuration (optional - for HTTPS support)
domain_name = ""                                    # Your domain name (e.g., "example.com")
ssl_email   = ""                                    # Email for Let's Encrypt SSL certificate

# Notes:
# 1. Create SSH key pair in AWS first: aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name doctor-channeling-key
# 2. Use strong passwords for MongoDB and Docker Hub
# 3. Restrict ssh_cidr_blocks to your IP for security
# 4. Domain name and SSL email are optional but recommended for production
# 5. SNS topic must be created separately if you want alarm notifications
